                        <h1>Divorced Fathers and Pizza Crusts</h1>
                        <p>
                        The connection between divorced fathers and pizza crusts<br>
                        is understandable. The divorced father does not cook<br>
                        confidently. He wants his kid to enjoy dinner.<br>
                        The entire weekend is supposed to be fun. Kids love<br>
                        pizza. For some reason involving soft warmth and malleability<br>
                         <br>
                        kids approve of melted cheese on pizza<br>
                        years before they will tolerate cheese in other situations.<br>
                        So the divorced father takes the kid and the kid's friend<br>
                        out for pizza. The kids eat much faster than the dad.<br>
                        Before the dad has finished his second slice,<br>
                         <br>
                        the kids are playing a video game or being Ace Ventura<br>
                        or blowing spitballs through straws, making this hail<br>
                        that can't quite be cleaned up. There are four slices left<br>
                        and the divorced father doesn't want them wasted,<br>
                        there has been enough waste already; he sits there<br>
                         <br>
                        in his windbreaker finishing the pizza. It's good<br>
                        except the crust is actually not so great—<br>
                        after the second slice the crust is basically a chore—<br>
                        so you leave it. You move on to the next loaded slice.<br>
                        Finally there you are amid rims of crust.<br>
                         <br>
                        All this is understandable. There's no dark conspiracy.<br>
                        Meanwhile the kids are having a pretty good time<br>
                        which is the whole point. So the entire evening makes<br>
                        clear sense. Now the divorced father gathers<br>
                        the sauce-stained napkins for the trash and dumps them<br>
                         <br>
                        and dumps the rims of crust which are not<br>
                        corpses on a battlefield. Understandability<br>
                        fills the pizza shop so thoroughly there's no room<br>
                        for anything else. Now he's at the door summoning the kids<br>
                        and they follow, of course they do, he's a dad.<br>
                        <br>
