                        <h1>The Book of Equality</h1>
                            <p>Here the readers gather to watch the books die. They die suddenly, as if thrown from<br> an airplane, or from spontaneous cardiac arrest. They live, and then suddenly they die,<br>and the reader who watches this is at the moment of the books' death bombarded with <br>images documented through the smiling lipstick face of a journalist who has shown up <br>to report on the death of the books. The milk was poisoned and forty-two babies died, <br>she laughs, as she fondles the ashes of the dead books. And the death of forty-two <br>babies is equal in value to the death of this book which is equal in value to the ninety-<br>year old woman who shot herself while the sheriff waited at her door with an eviction <br>notice which is equal in value to the collapsing of the global economy which is equal to <br>the military in country XYZ seizing the land of the semi-nomadic hunters and <br>cultivators of crops who have lived in the local rain forest for thousands of years. The <br>reader opens a dead book and finds an infinite amount of burnt ash between the <br>bindings, and when the ash blows in the wind the lipstick says that every death in the <br>world is equal to every other death in the world which is equal to every birth in the <br>world which is equal to every act of dismemberment which is equal to the death of a <br>jungle which is equal to the collapse of the global economy; and hey look there’s <br>another lady falling out of a window; she looks about equal to the poet hurled out of <br>his country for words he wrote but which did not belong to him and whose death is <br>about equal to the girl who was shot on the bus on her way to school this morning <br>which is just about the same as the bearded man whose head was shoved into a sac <br>while water was dumped over it and he died for an instant and came back to life and <br>talked and talked and that’s about equal to the steroid illegally injected into the arm of <br>a beautiful man who makes forty million dollars a year for injecting his arms with <br>steroids so he can more skillfully wave a wooden stick at a ball, and in the ash we see <br>the truest democracy there ever was: hey look it’s a little baby found in a dumpster <br>how equal you are says the smiling lipstick to the civilized nation whose citizens walk <br>the flooded streets looking for their homes, and in the ashes of the dead book the dead <br>streets are equal to the eating disorders of movie stars which are equal to the dead <br>soldiers who are equal to the homeruns which are equal to the bomb dropped by <br>country ABC over weddings in the village of country XYZ which is equal to the earth <br>swallowing up and devouring all of its foreigners which is just about equal to the <br>decline in literacy in the most educated nation in the planet. There is no end to this <br>book. There are no paragraph breaks to interrupt the smiling lipstick that goes <br>on and on in one string of ashy words about how the declaration of peace is equal to the <br>resumption of war and how the bodies that fall are equal to the birds that ascend and <br>how the bomb in the Eiffel Tower is equal to the rising cost of natural gas, and the <br>murmurs of the voices in the mud are equal to the murmurs of the expensive suits <br>falling out of buildings and these are equal to the silence that kills with one breath and <br>coddles life with another.<br>
